Notes
- pieces know their position on the board
- the board holds each piece in a position
- each piece checks if a move is valid (based on the piece and whether or not in bounds)
- each player randomly assigned white or black, white goes first
- game checks at each stage if the game is over; stalemates should be considered game over
- ask each player for his/her name
